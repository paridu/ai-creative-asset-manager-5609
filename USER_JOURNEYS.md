# Designer User Journeys: ARCHIVE-AI

## Journey 1: The "Messy Desktop" Cleanup (Ingestion)
**Goal:** Import 500+ unorganized files and have them categorized instantly.
1.  **Trigger:** Designer has a folder named "Project_Final_v2_FINAL" full of mixed assets.
2.  **Action:** Designer drags the entire folder into ARCHIVE-AI's "Smart Drop" zone.
3.  **System Process:**
    *   AI analyzes each file.
    *   Generates a "Creative Brief" summary for the folder.
    *   Extracts common color palettes and fonts.
    *   Assigns tags (e.g., #Illustration, #WebUI, #DarkTheme).
4.  **Outcome:** Designer sees a clean, searchable library instead of a list of cryptic filenames.

## Journey 2: The "Need Inspiration" Search (Retrieval)
**Goal:** Find a specific UI element used in a project from two years ago.
1.  **Trigger:** Designer needs a "Glassmorphism Login Card" they previously designed.
2.  **Action:** Designer types "frosted glass login screen with blue buttons" into the semantic search bar.
3.  **System Process:**
    *   AI searches through vector embeddings of all stored assets.
    *   Ranks results by visual relevance, not just filename matches.
4.  **Outcome:** The exact file appears in the top 3 results. Designer clicks "Open in Figma" to resume work.

## Journey 3: The Brand Audit (Consistency)
**Goal:** Ensure all assets for a specific client use the correct brand colors.
1.  **Trigger:** Creative Director needs to check if the new social media assets match the brand guidelines.
2.  **Action:** Director filters the library by "Client: Acme Corp" and selects the "Color Palette" filter for #FF5733.
3.  **System Process:**
    *   System displays all assets containing that specific HEX code or similar shades.
4.  **Outcome:** Director identifies three outdated assets using the wrong shade of orange and flags them for update.
