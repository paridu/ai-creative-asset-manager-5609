# Product Vision: ARCHIVE-AI (The Designer's Second Brain)

## 1. Core Mission
To eliminate the "Search & Recovery" tax in the creative process. ARCHIVE-AI transforms passive file storage into an active, intelligent creative partner that understands design intent, not just filenames.

## 2. Strategic Pillars
*   **Zero-Effort Organization:** AI-driven ingestion that tags, categorizes, and extracts color palettes/fonts without manual input.
*   **Semantic Intelligence:** Searching for "vibrant summer vibes" should return relevant files even if they are named "Untitled_Final_v2.png".
*   **Asset Recyclability:** Breaking down complex design files (Figma, PSD, AI) into reusable components (icons, buttons, patterns).

## 3. Target Audience
*   **Individual Designers:** Freelancers managing thousands of scattered assets.
*   **Design Agencies:** Teams needing a unified "source of truth" for brand assets.
*   **Enterprise Marketing:** Large-scale operations requiring consistent asset reuse across global regions.

## 4. Value Proposition
"Stop digging, start designing." We return 25% of a designer's week by automating metadata management and providing instant asset discovery.
